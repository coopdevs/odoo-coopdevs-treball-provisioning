# Ansible scripts to provision and deploy Odoo

These are [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/) playbooks (scripts) for managing an [Odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) server.

## Requirements

You will need Ansible on your machine to run the playbooks.
These playbooks will install the PostgreSQL database, NodeJS and Python virtualenv to manage python packages.

It has currently been tested on **Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial (64 bit)**.


Install dependencies running:
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Playbooks

### sys_admins.yml

This playbook will prepare the host to allow access to all the system administrators.

In each environment (`dev`, `staging`, `production`) we can find the list of users that will be created as system administrators.
We use `host_vars` to declare per environment variables:
```yaml
# inventory/host_vars/<YOUR_HOST>/config.yml

sys_admins:
  - name: pepe
    ssh_key: "../pub_keys/pepe.pub"
    state: present
    - name: paco
    ssh_key: "../pub_keys/paco.pub"
    state: present
```

The first time you run it against a brand new host you need to run it as `root` user.
You'll also need passwordless SSH access to the `root` user.
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/sys_admins.yml --limit=<environment_name> -u root
```

For the following executions, the script will asssume that your user is included in the system administrators list for the given host.

For example in the case of `development` environment the script will assume that the user that is running it is included in the system administrators [list](https://github.com/coopdevs/timeoverflow-provisioning/blob/master/inventory/host_vars/local.timeoverflow.org/config.yml#L5) for that environment.

To run the playbook as a system administrator just use the following command:
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/sys_admins.yml --limit=dev
```
Ansible will try to connect to the host using the system user. If your user as a system administrator is different than your local system user please run this playbook with the correct user using the `-u` flag.
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/sys_admins.yml --limit=dev -u <username>
```

### Provision
`provision.yml` - Installs and configures all required software on the server.

TASKS:
- Create odoo user
- Create directories structure
- Install common packages
- Install PostgreSQL database and create a user
- Install NodeJS and LESS

### Deploy
`deploy.yml` - Deploys source code from Odoo Nightly and installs Python requirements.

TASKS:
- Install and create VirtualEnv
- Ansistrano deploy:
  - Download the source code
  - Before link task: Build
  - Before link task: Install requirements.txt
- Add systemd service

### Deploy Custom Modules
`deploy_custom_modules.yml` - Deploys the custom or thirdy part modules that you need.

You can make a repository with submodules pointing your module repository. [Like in this example](https://github.com/danypr92/odoo-organization-custom-modules)

Put custom modules repository url in your `inventory/host_vars/your_host/config.yml` file:

```yml
#inventory/host_vars/<YOUR_HOST>/config.yml

custom_modules_repo: https://github.com/danypr92/odoo-organization-custom-modules.git
custom:modules_repo_branch: master
```

TASKS:
- Ansistrano git deploy.
- Update odoo.service to add addons.

## Roles

### sys_admin

- Creates system administrator users and add SSH keys

### Common

- Create `odoo` user and group
- Installs system packages
- Creates folder structure and configures permissions
- Creates virtualenv
- Installs PostgreSQL and NodeJS
- Adds service unit
    
### Odoo Config

- Creates Odoo configuration file
- Restarts Odoo service

# Installation instructions

### Step 1 - sys_admins

The **first time** thet execute this playbook use the user `root`

`ansible-playbook playbooks/sysadmins.yml --limit <environment_name> -u root`

All the next times use your personal system administrator user:

`ansible-playbook playbooks/sysadmins.yml --limit <environment_name> -u USER`

USER --> Your sysadmin user name.

### Step 2 - Provision

`ansible-playbook playbooks/provision.yml -u USER`

USER --> Your sysadmin user name.

### Step 3 - Deploy

`ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy.yml -u USER`

USER --> Your user name (not need be sysadmin)

### Step 4 - Deploy custom modules

`ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy_custom_modules.yml -u USER`

USER --> Your user name (not need be sysadmin)

## System Administration

### Default User `odoo`

Used to execute `odoo.service` and is a a superuser.

### System Administrators

The sysadmins are the superusers of the environment.
They have `sudo` access without password for all commands.

**They can execute `sys_admins.yml`, `provision.yml`, `deploy.yml` and `deploy_custom_modules.yml` playbooks.**

------------------------------
To rewrite:

### Users (Developers)

They are users without `sudo` permissions.
They are in the `odoo` group and can execute the next commands withous password in `sudo` mode:

```
sudo systemctl start odoo.service
sudo systemctl stop odoo.service
sudo systemctl status odoo.service
sudo systemctl restart odoo.service
```

**They can execute `deploy.yml` and `deploy_custom_modules.yml` playbooks.**

------------------------------

## DB Admin Password

Add password to the `super admin` that manage the dbs.
In `inventory/host_vars/host_name/secrets.yml` add the key `admin_passwd` to protect the creation and management of dbs.
`secrets.yml` is a encrypted vault. Run `ansible-vault edit secrets.yml` to change this password.

# Development

In the development environment (`local.odoo.net`) you must use the sysadmin user `odoo`.

`ssh odoo@local.odoo.net`

## Using LXC Containers

In order to run the `scripts/create-contqainer.sh` script, you need install [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/).

The script in `scripts/create-container.sh` will help you to create a development environment using LXC containers.

The script will:

* Create container
* Mount your project directory into container in `/opt/<project_name>`
* Add container IP to `/etc/hosts`
* Create `odoo` group with same `gid` of project directory
* Create `odoo` user with same `uid` and `gid` of project directory
* Add system user's SSH public key to `odoo` user
* Install python2.7 in container
* Run `sys_admins.yml` playbook

When the execution ends, you have a container ready to provision and deploy the app.

__You can find the configuration variables in `scripts/confg/lxc.cfg`.__
